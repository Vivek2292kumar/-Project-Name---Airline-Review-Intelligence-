        "The airline review dataset provides insights into customer experiences across various airlines, allowing us to investigate patterns and factors that influence customer satisfaction. The dataset includes 17 columns with information on key aspects such as overall ratings, seat comfort, cabin service, food and beverage quality, entertainment, ground service, and value for money. Each review is associated with details about the reviewer, the travel date, type of aircraft, cabin class, traveler type (e.g., business or leisure), route, and whether the reviewer recommends the airline. This project aims to leverage the data to uncover trends, correlations, and drivers of positive and negative experiences, helping airlines make data-driven improvements to customer service.\n",
        "\n",
        "Objectives\n",
        "Identify Key Drivers of Customer Satisfaction: Using correlations and detailed analysis, we aim to identify which factors (such as seat comfort, entertainment, or food quality) contribute most significantly to overall customer satisfaction. By understanding these drivers, airlines can prioritize improvements in areas that most impact customer perceptions.\n",
        "\n",
        "Analyze Trends Over Time: By exploring the review_date column, we will analyze how customer satisfaction has evolved over time. This temporal analysis may reveal trends in service quality, the impact of external factors (e.g., changes due to COVID-19), or how airlines have adapted their services over the years.\n",
        "\n",
        "Evaluate Airline Performance: By comparing the average ratings across airlines, we can rank them according to customer satisfaction. This will reveal the best and worst-performing airlines, highlighting industry leaders and areas for improvement among competitors.\n",
        "\n",
        "Understand Traveler Preferences: By examining traveler types (such as solo, family, or business travelers) and cabin classes (economy, business, or first class), we aim to understand how experiences vary by traveler segment. This analysis can inform targeted service enhancements, allowing airlines to cater more effectively to different customer needs.\n",
        "\n",
        "Data Analysis Techniques\n",
        "Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): We will start with EDA to examine distributions, detect outliers, and understand basic statistics related to customer ratings and reviews. This includes visualizing rating distributions, top routes, and popular airlines through histograms, bar charts, and pie charts.\n",
        "\n",
        "Correlation Analysis: A correlation heatmap will be used to explore relationships between the various ratings (e.g., seat comfort, entertainment, cabin service, etc.). This will help us identify which service aspects are most strongly correlated with overall satisfaction.\n",
        "\n",
        "Sentiment Analysis (Optional): If time permits, we may analyze the customer_review text column for sentiment, categorizing reviews as positive, neutral, or negative. This qualitative analysis would provide insights into common themes and recurring customer concerns, complementing the quantitative rating data.\n",
        "\n",
        "Time Series Analysis: With review_date and date_flown columns, we will analyze changes in ratings over time. This will allow us to see if certain airlines or services have improved or declined in customer satisfaction.\n",
        "\n",
        "Visualization Techniques\n",
        "Using libraries like seaborn and matplotlib, visualizations such as bar charts, box plots, pie charts, and heatmaps will convey findings effectively. For instance, a heatmap will show correlations among ratings, while box plots will compare satisfaction across cabin types.\n",
        "\n",
        "Expected Outcomes\n",
        "This analysis will provide insights into the strengths and weaknesses of different airlines, helping them to improve customer experience. For instance, if seat comfort shows a strong correlation with overall satisfaction, airlines might focus on upgrading seating across cabins. Similarly, understanding traveler-type preferences allows airlines to personalize services based on customer profiles.\n",
        "\n",
        "By presenting these insights in a concise visual dashboard, the project can assist airlines in enhancing service quality, thereby improving their market position and customer loyalty."
